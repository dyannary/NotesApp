**ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

In the context of this project, we had the opportunity to employ various design patterns, with seven of them being part of the Gang of Four (GoF). 

Each pattern addresses a specific problem and provides an efficient, industry-tested solution. Concerning design patterns, we utilized a diverse range of patterns in the development of our application. 

For instancewe used: 
- Factory Method for flexible object creation
- Builder for step-by-step construction of complex objects
- Prototype for cloning and creating new objects
- Adapter for interface adaptation
- Decorator for adding additional functionalities to existing objects
- Memento for saving and restoring object states
- State for managing states
- Proxy for controlling access to objects.

Our project was implemented on the ASP.NET C# platform, along with the Blazor framework, providing a robust and high-performance environment for the development of our application.

Through this application, users have access to tools that allow them to create and customize notes, add tasks based on priorities, and plan events in a personalized calendar. 
The application caters to the needs of students and those seeking more efficient organization in the field of studies.
